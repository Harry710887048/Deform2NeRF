**News**

* `07/09/2022` We release the extended version of Animatable NeRF (now dubbed [Animatable Neural Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.08133)). We evaluated three different versions of Animatable Neural Fields, including vanilla Animatable NeRF, a version where the neural blend weight field is replaced with displacement field and a version where the canonical NeRF model is replaced with a neural surface field (output is SDF instead of volume density, also using displacement field). We also provide evaluation framework for reconstruction quality comparison.
* `10/28/2021` To make the comparison with Animatable NeRF easier on the Human3.6M dataset, we save the quantitative results at [here](https://zjueducn-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/pengsida_zju_edu_cn/EbpGvw8LvnFHislCMRzlpLkBNcIdJeWuc96TOJhQ1gX7cQ?e=nirNmn), which also contains the results of other methods, including Neural Body, D-NeRF, Multi-view Neural Human Rendering, and Deferred Neural Human Rendering.

## Extended Version

Addtional training and test commandlines are recorded in [train.sh](train.sh) and [test.sh](test.sh).

Moreover, we compiled a list of all possible commands to run in [extension.sh](extension.sh) using on the S9 sequence of the Human3.6M dataset.

This include training, evaluating and visualizing the original Animatable NeRF implementation and all three extented versions.

Here we list the portion of the commands for the SDF-PDF configuration:

```shell
# extension: anisdf_pdf

# evaluating on training poses for anisdf_pdf
python run.py --type evaluate --cfg_file configs/sdf_pdf/anisdf_pdf_s9p.yaml exp_name anisdf_pdf_s9p resume True

# evaluating on novel poses for anisdf_pdf
python run.py --type evaluate --cfg_file configs/sdf_pdf/anisdf_pdf_s9p.yaml exp_name anisdf_pdf_s9p resume True test_novel_pose True

# visualizing novel view of 0th frame for anisdf_pdf
python run.py --type visualize --cfg_file configs/sdf_pdf/anisdf_pdf_s9p.yaml exp_name anisdf_pdf_s9p resume True vis_novel_view True begin_ith_frame 0

# visualizing animation of 3rd camera for anisdf_pdf
python run.py --type visualize --cfg_file configs/sdf_pdf/anisdf_pdf_s9p.yaml exp_name anisdf_pdf_s9p resume True vis_pose_sequence True test_view "3,"

# generating posed mesh for anisdf_pdf
python run.py --type visualize --cfg_file configs/sdf_pdf/anisdf_pdf_s9p.yaml exp_name anisdf_pdf_s9p vis_posed_mesh True

# training base model for anisdf_pdf
python train_net.py --cfg_file configs/sdf_pdf/anisdf_pdf_s9p.yaml exp_name anisdf_pdf_s9p resume False
```

To run Animatable NeRF on other officially supported datasets, simply change the `--cfg_file` and `exp_name` parameters.

Note that for Animatable NeRF with pose-dependent displacement field (NeRF-PDF) and Animatable Neural Surface with pose-dependent displacement field (SDF-PDF), there's no need for training the blend weight fields of unseen human poses.
